# BinBoop

BinBoop is a small Docker-ready Python utility which checks the Cambridge City Council bin collection API and alerts me via Pushover when the bins need to go out.

To learn how to set up and use BinBoop, check out [my blog post](https://raphaelkabo.com/blog/undocumented-bin-collection-api/).
